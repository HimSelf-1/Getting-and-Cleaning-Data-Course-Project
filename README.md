Analysis files:
==================================================================
Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on their waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the study captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed to obtain 128 readings/window.. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See the study “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset“ 'features_info.txt' for more details.  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
For each record the study provided:
=====================================
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
The dataset analized includes the following files:
=========================================
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Explanation of how the script works:   One R script run_analysis.R was created that does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Detail of steps:
Step 1.       Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	1.	Create data directory if it does not exist
	2.	Download data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	3.	Read in the data into tables - NOTE:  the suffix _train & _test refer to the group the subjects were placed in
	•	Subject files using subject_train.txt & subject_test.txt which contains the subject identification
		o	subject_train
		o	subject_test
	•	Activity files using Y_train.txt & Y_test.txt which contains the activity the subject performed
		o	activity_train
		o	activity_test
	•	Feature files using X_train.txt & X_test.txt which contains the data from the activities the subjects performed
		o	feature_train
		o	feature_test
 	4. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
	•	Merge like data into a single file
		o	subject_df using files subject_train & subject_test
		o	activity_df using files activity_train & activity_test
		o	features_df using files feature_train & feature_test
 	5. Assign names to variables from provided data set
	•	subject_df  assign subject
	•	activity_df assign activity
 	6. Read descriptive feature names from features.txt into featureNames
 	* Rename variables in features_df using the feature names from column 2 of featureNames
 	7. Merge columns to get a data frame for all data
		1.	data_s_a using files subject_df & activity_df
		2.	total_data using files features_df & data_s_a
Step 2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	1.	filter_on_names_of_int from file featureNames with contain strings with mean() or std() in name of features
	2.	Subset into names_of_int based on subject & activity from filter_on_names_of_int
	•	data_of_int is a subset of total_data based on names_of_int
Step 3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 	1. Read descriptive activity names from activity_labels.txt into activityNames
 	2. Factor variable activity in data_of_int
 	3. Overwrite activity in data_of_int with descriptive activity names
Step 4.	Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
	Already completed in the R Script:    
	•	Re-labeled activity in data_of_int with descriptive activity name
	•	Read descriptive feature names from features.txt
	•	Assigned names to variables from provided data set : subject & activity
	Based on the features_info.txt file, the following actions were taken:
	•	Time domain signals are prefixed with a 't'; strings beginning with a 't' replaced with 'time'
	•	Frequency domain signals are prefixed with an 'f'; strings beginning with an 'f' replaced with 'frequency'
	•	Strings containing 'Acc' were replaced with 'Accelerometer'
	•	Strings containing 'Gyro' were replaced with 'Gyroscope'
	•	Strings containing 'Mag' were replaced with 'Magnitude'
	•	Strings containing 'BodyBody' were replaced with 'Body_Force_Calculated'
	•	Strings containing 'mean()' were replaced with 'Mean_value'
	•	Strings containing 'std()' were replaced with 'Standard_deviation'
Step 5.	From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	•	Load library 'plyr'
	1.	Aggregate data frame data_of_int by each activity and subjectinto df, returning means for numeric variables
	2.	Order/sort the results in df by subject and then activity
	3.	Save  the tidy data df into tidydataset.txt
Data tables of analysis observations:
	data table data_of_int with all variables along with units
		•	contains 10,299 obs. of 68 variables
		•	subject and activity variables are interger values
		•	subject is an unique id for each member of the group of 30 volunteers
		•	Each subject performed six activities : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
		•	Variables prefixed with time have units of seconds, and those with frequency are in Hertz (Hz)
		•	all variables prefixed with time or frequency are numeric measurement values from the experiment:
	data table df with all variables and summaries calculated mean along with units
		•	contains 180 obs. of 68 variables
		•	subject and activity variables are interger values
		•	subject is an unique id for each member of the group of 30 volunteers
		•	Each subject performed six activities : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
